## Features
1. Static Image Processing: Detect and annotate hand landmarks on static images.
2. Real-Time Webcam Input: Track and visualize hand movements using a webcam.
3. Hand Landmark Drawing: Draw connections between hand landmarks for better visualization.
4. Hand World Landmarks Plotting: Visualize 3D hand landmarks.
